# Web Design for Everybody (WD4E) Capstone

This is my final project of WD4E Capstone.  The site is build based on the
bootstrap templete 
[Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)
from
[Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/)

## [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

[Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) is a one
page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features
several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full
page portfolio item modals, and a working PHP contact form.
